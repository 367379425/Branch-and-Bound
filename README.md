# Branch-and-Bound
Self-learning: Hand code branch and bound method for better understanding of its thoughts

# Code feature ⛄

+ Coding with **gurobipy (Gurobi)** is beneficial because it can solve Linear Programming (LP) problems in a clear way. Additionally, as one of the established comprehensive problem solves, its standard class allow me to code easily and correctly.   
+ Focusing on **Branch and Bound method (B&B)**, which actually bounds before it branches. I'm going to hand-code the B&B procedure.
+ ...

# Codes 

- I coded B&B in **BranchAndBoundProcedure.py**
- **B&B Procedure.ipynb** provides an example to use.

# To Do List 😶‍🌫️

* Provide a **schematic diagram** of my understanding about B&B.
* Extend my code to be more general. Now my B&B only use linear relaxation and the strategy implemented in my code has limitations. For a instance, there are many other methods for models relaxation and various branch rules.
* My temporary goal is to replicate the algorithm describe in particular paper my teacher required me to do.🙃
